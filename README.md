## Introduction
*Conway's Game of Life* (GoL) is perhaps the most famous cellular automaton.

### The rules of the game
The board consists of a grid of *cells*, each either *alive* or *dead*. At each step the board is updated according to there rules:
	1. A live cell with less than two live neighbours dies (i.e. its state goes from *alive* to *dead*)
	2. A live cell with more than three live neighbours dies
	3. A live cell with two or three live neighbours stays alive
	4. A dead cell with three live neighbours becomes alive.

## Our project
We implemented the rules of GoL in Python, using the
